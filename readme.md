# Car Features, Price, and Popularity
## by Robert Bruton


## Dataset

The dataset I chose for analysis is the "Car Features and MSRP" dataset by CooperUnion on Kaggle. This dataset features 16 columns of variables for almost 12,000 rows of observations. The data was originally scraped from Edmunds and Twitter. This dataset can be found at: https://www.kaggle.com/CooperUnion/cardataset
